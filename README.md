For the 17000 plus search results in Google Scholar we will assign years to people. Each will get set of years to work on and load to Zotero - each works with Zotero connection and get the PDF too (to the shared folder) later export to bib

See [searching by years sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wz31b_jCWY_bAhFaZoCsERhvjUNxoH9npZ2MNhn0XD8/edit#gid=1791116862)
