Systematic review of the methods to support decisions based analysis of decision supporting holistic modeling methods

Knit everything from the index.Rmd file

---- Search keywords ----

“decision”+(“intervention”OR”policy”)+“uncertainty”+(“expert”OR”stakeholder”)+(“model“OR”monte carlo”OR”simulation”OR”Bayesian”OR”computer assisted”)+(“value of information”OR”information accuracy”)

---- Steps ----

For the 17000 plus search results in Google Scholar we will assign years to people. Each will get set of years to work on and load to Zotero - each works with Zotero connection and get the PDF too (to the shared folder) later export to bib

See [searching by years sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wz31b_jCWY_bAhFaZoCsERhvjUNxoH9npZ2MNhn0XD8/edit#gid=1791116862)


and the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CWWhitney/hosyana_review/issues/3) that outlines the scholar search and Zotero paper loading process

# Protocol

1. Download Zotero connector for your web interface (i.e. chrome connector)

2. Join the zotero collection 22_Methods-Review-decisions (super secret and only for hortibonn people, ask if you need a link)

3. Google Scholar search with keywords -> “decision”+(“intervention”OR”policy”)+“uncertainty”+(“expert”OR”stakeholder”)+(“model“OR”monte carlo”OR”simulation”OR”Bayesian”OR”computer assisted”)+(“value of information”OR”information accuracy”)

4. Upload information for each of the papers, for subsets of years into zotero - using zotero connector https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wz31b_jCWY_bAhFaZoCsERhvjUNxoH9npZ2MNhn0XD8/edit#gid=1791116862

5. Add notes and tags - using information from the pdf or the link in snapshot (usually the abstract already has enough information)

6. These notes and tags should outline either the reason for exclusion (a note proceeded by 'Bin:' i.e.

 - and/or - 

Tags with the relevant information about the paper including, but not limited to, field of application, method applied, and any other information and indication that let's us know why the paper is included

**7. Regroup and discuss next steps (here they are preliminarily):**  
8. re-organize files and move to new relevant folders, i.e. remove binned items to own folder (bin), remove papers that share application, methods etc. to shared folders for beginning the synthesis

9. Divide initial stage of synthesis into chapters (according to folders)

10. Export bib files of each folder  and add to Github collection, reference in YAML of the `index` file

11. Write synthesis
