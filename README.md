# Protocol

1. Join the Zotero collection 22_Methods-Review-decisions (super secret and only for hortibonn people; ask if you need a link)

1. Add notes and tags - using information from the pdf or the link in snapshot (usually the abstract already has enough information)

1. These notes and tags should outline either the reason for exclusion (a note proceeded by 'Bin:' i.e.

Regroup and discuss next steps (here they are preliminary):

1. re-organize files and move them to new relevant folders, i.e. remove binned items to their own folder (bin), remove papers that share applications, methods etc. to shared folders for beginning the synthesis

1. Divide the initial stage of synthesis into chapters (according to folders)

1. Export bib files of each folder and add to the Github collection, reference in YAML of the `index` file

1. Write synthesis
